So now it's another real go at fedi'ing. Since Elon marched on Twitter,  Mastodon has been flooded with new users. Not sure how many will stay, of course, but it sure ups the ante in terms of offering something for everyone. The standard cool-kid reaction has been that Mast has been a home for nerd-dads -- which of course it has been -- but that's changed already. With everyone trying it out now, though, will it change completely, or will they all leave when the dopamine hits dry up in a few weeks?
