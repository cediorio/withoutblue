Long time, no post (he says to the void). Trying once again to focus on the fediverse and wean myself off Twitter. Why? Why spend 
the time relearning/retooling/etc when Twitter is easy? Well, for one thing, people/artists whose work I respect/admire are there 
(@neauoire@merveilles.town, @darius@friend.camp) and finding more all the time.
