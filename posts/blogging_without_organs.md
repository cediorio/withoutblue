The series is refractory

<blockquote>Desiring-production forms a binary-linear system. The full body is
  introduced as a third term in the series, without destroying,
  however, the essential binary-linear nature of this series: 2, 1, 2,
  1... The series is completely refractory to a transcription that
  would transform and mold it into a specifically ternary and
  triangular schema such as Oedipus. The full body without organs is
  produced as anti-production, that is to say it intervenes within the
  process as such for the sole purpose of rejecting any attempt to
  impose on it any sort of triangulation implying that it was produced
  by parents.  </blockquote>
