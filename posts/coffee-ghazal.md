This coffee, a dark melodrama, a brew that sits me down;  
an ancient beggar with false modesty and heavy words.

Where is my waking? he asks. The sun is bright and lidded with cloud;  
waking walks wide round me, avoids me. A plague is how it treats me.

Open up your mouth. Coffee words and bent coins token your teeth.  
You cringe for the heat. Exchange.
