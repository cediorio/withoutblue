So I finally got around to a revamp/resuscitation of my old site. Decided to go with a static site 
generator -- [11ty](https://www.11ty.dev/) -- and pretty much custom css via [tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/), 
hosted on netlify, with automatic build process with every commit to github. 

Got it set up over the weekend, which was mostly a process of learning both of the tools, but the end result is
being able to edit a markdown file in a posts directory, pushing to github and having it published. Nice.
