<pre>
the principalities of narrative and attention
concern you

the description of a perfect thing
unfolds in the reverse origami of its arguments

its border of ambiguities
means senselessness is a colour

and fragments just a currency
of virulence, synced to all personality

that is what the codes mean, for you
for personality is the intact verb, the truss of dross,
the mechanics, code to wind around,
with wires pleating the magnets, most of them
instant and mirthful, the dredged single, I -- current
running,
